Kaiming He is one of the most influential researchers in modern artificial intelligence, widely recognized for his groundbreaking contributions to deep learning, computer vision, and large-scale neural network training. His work has shaped the architectures and techniques that power today’s most advanced AI systems.

Born in China, Kaiming He received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Tsinghua University before earning his Ph.D. from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Early in his career, he joined Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), where he conducted fundamental research in image processing and recognition. He later moved to Facebook AI Research (FAIR)—now Meta AI—where he became a leading figure in deep learning innovation. He is currently a researcher at FAIR and a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), continuing to advance the frontiers of AI.

Kaiming He is best known for being the first author of the **ResNet (Deep Residual Learning)** paper, introduced at CVPR 2016. ResNet pioneered the use of residual connections, solving the vanishing gradient problem and enabling the training of extremely deep neural networks. It remains one of the most cited and widely used architectures in the history of deep learning, forming the foundation for numerous modern models in computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal AI.

Beyond ResNet, Kaiming He has contributed to a wide range of influential works, including:

- **Mask R-CNN:** A powerful framework for instance segmentation and object detection.
    
- **Faster R-CNN:** A landmark two-stage detector that greatly improved real-time object detection.
    
- **R-CNN family:** Foundational work that defined the modern era of object detection.
    
- **FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks):** A core technique enabling multi-scale feature learning.
    
- **Momentum contrast (MoCo):** A major contribution to self-supervised learning.
    

These projects have become standard components of modern computer vision systems, influencing both academic research and industrial applications such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, robotics, video analysis, and medical imaging.

Kaiming He’s research style is characterized by clarity, practicality, and strong mathematical intuition. His works often introduce simple yet transformative ideas that open new directions for the field. He has received numerous top honors in computer vision and AI, including multiple CVPR Best Paper Awards.

Today, Kaiming He continues to explore fundamental problems in AI—ranging from representation learning to model scalability—while shaping the design principles of next-generation neural networks. His contributions have made him one of the most respected and impactful scientists in artificial intelligence.
