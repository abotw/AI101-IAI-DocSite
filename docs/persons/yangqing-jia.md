Yangqing Jia is a highly influential engineer and researcher in the field of artificial intelligence, best known as the creator of **Caffe**, one of the earliest and most impactful deep learning frameworks. His work has played a critical role in the transition of deep learning from academic research into practical, scalable industrial systems.

Yangqing Jia was born and raised in China and later moved to the United States for higher education. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied under the supervision of Professor Trevor Darrell. During his doctoral research at Berkeley AI Research (BAIR), he developed **Caffe**, a groundbreaking deep learning framework that combined clarity, speed, and modularity. Released in 2014, Caffe quickly became one of the most widely used open-source frameworks in computer vision, powering research in image classification, detection, and multimedia applications.

After his graduate work, Yangqing Jia joined Google, where he contributed to large-scale machine learning and deep learning infrastructure. He later moved to Facebook (now Meta), where he played a pivotal role in building **PyTorch 2.0’s** underlying compiler technologies and advancing Facebook’s AI platforms. At Facebook AI Research (FAIR), he also helped lead the development of **Caffe2**, the next-generation production-oriented deep learning framework designed for mobile deployment, distributed training, and cloud-scale inference.

Beyond framework development, Yangqing Jia has been deeply involved in the engineering of large-scale AI platforms and the integration of deep learning into real-world products. His teams have worked on performance optimization, model deployment, machine learning compilers, and unified training/inference ecosystems that support billions of users worldwide.

In industry, Yangqing Jia is respected for his ability to bridge **research innovation** with **practical engineering**, creating tools that are both theoretically strong and highly usable at scale. His open-source contributions—particularly Caffe—played a major role in democratizing deep learning and accelerating its wider adoption before PyTorch and TensorFlow became dominant.

Following his contributions at Meta, he took on leadership roles in large technology companies, focusing on cloud-scale AI, machine learning infrastructure, and the modernization of software ecosystems for AI-driven applications.

Today, Yangqing Jia continues to influence the direction of AI engineering, distributed training, and large-scale model deployment. His vision centers on building efficient, accessible, and robust AI systems that empower researchers and engineers worldwide. As both a researcher and an engineering leader, he remains one of the key figures in shaping how modern AI frameworks and infrastructures are designed.
