# Fei-Fei Li | 李飞飞

Fei-Fei Li is one of the most influential figures in modern artificial intelligence, particularly in the fields of computer vision and cognitive science. Widely recognized as a pioneer of the deep learning era, she is best known for initiating and leading the ImageNet project, a breakthrough that fundamentally transformed how machines perceive and understand visual data.

Born in Beijing and raised in both China and the United States, Fei-Fei Li completed her undergraduate studies in physics at Princeton University and earned her Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Her interdisciplinary background—spanning physics, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering—has played a key role in shaping her research vision: to build AI systems that see and think in ways inspired by human cognition.

Fei-Fei Li is a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and the founding director of the Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute (HAI). She previously served as the director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) and was the Chief Scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud, where she helped guide industrial AI research and deployment.

Her most celebrated achievement, the ImageNet dataset, dramatically accelerated the progress of AI by providing an unprecedented large-scale benchmark for image recognition. It laid the groundwork for the success of deep convolutional neural networks and triggered the “ImageNet moment,” a turning point that propelled modern AI into widespread real-world applications.

Beyond technical contributions, Fei-Fei Li is also a leading advocate for **human-centered AI**, emphasizing fairness, ethics, inclusiveness, and the social responsibility of technology. She frequently engages with policymakers, educators, and global organizations to promote the safe and beneficial development of artificial intelligence.

Today, Fei-Fei Li continues to shape the future of AI through her research in visual intelligence, robotics perception, and cognition-inspired machine learning, while also championing diversity and the human values at the core of technological advancement.
