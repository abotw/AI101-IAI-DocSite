## Project Structure

AI101 is designed as a documentation site with the following structure:

```
AI101/
├─ docs/          # Markdown files for AI topics
├─ assets/        # Images, diagrams, and examples
├─ tutorials/     # Step-by-step tutorials and hands-on exercises
├─ examples/      # Code snippets and demo projects
├─ index.md       # Homepage / overview
└─ README.md      # Project introduction
```

This structure ensures content is modular, easy to maintain, and scalable as the site grows.
